Brian Jepson's YBox2 InfoWidget backend as described in:

http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/06/ybox2_web20_dashboard_at.html

If you want, you can follow the instructions on the blog and use the
hosted version on my web site.

But if you want to customize this for your own use, feel free! You'll 
need to add your Flickr and Technorati API keys to the hello.cgi file.
Also, you need to install the LWP Perl module for this to work.
